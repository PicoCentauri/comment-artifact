# Contributing

ðŸŽ‰ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute to _comment-artifact_! ðŸŽ‰

The action created from the
[typescript-action template](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action) and
more detailed information about the code structure are given there. If you want
to contribute but feel a bit lost, do not hesitate to contact us and ask your
questions! We will happily mentor you through your first contributions.

## Initial Setup

After you've cloned the repository to your local machine or codespace, you'll
need to perform some initial setup steps before you can develop your action.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You'll need to have a reasonably modern version of
> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) handy (20.x or later should work!). If you are
> using a version manager like [`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) or
> [`fnm`](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), this template has a `.node-version`
> file at the root of the repository that can be used to automatically switch to
> the correct version when you `cd` into the repository. Additionally, this
> `.node-version` file is used by GitHub Actions in any `actions/setup-node`
> actions.

1. :hammer_and_wrench: Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. :building_construction: Package the TypeScript for distribution

   ```bash
   npm run bundle
   ```

1. :white_check_mark: Run the tests

   ```bash
   $ npm test

   PASS  ./index.test.js
     âœ“ throws invalid number (3ms)
     âœ“ wait 500 ms (504ms)
     âœ“ test runs (95ms)

   ...
   ```

## Update the Action Code

The [`src/`](./src/) directory is the heart of this action! This contains the
source code that will be run when the action is invoked.

There are a few things to keep in mind when writing your action code:

- Most GitHub Actions toolkit and CI/CD operations are processed asynchronously.
  In `main.ts`, you will see that the action is run in an `async` function.

  ```javascript
  import * as core from '@actions/core'
  //...

  async function run() {
    try {
      //...
    } catch (error) {
      core.setFailed(error.message)
    }
  }
  ```

  For more information about the GitHub Actions toolkit, see the
  [documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md).

1. Create a new branch

   ```bash
   git checkout -b bugfix
   ```

1. Update the contents of `src/`
1. Add tests to `__tests__/` for the new feature or bugfix
1. Format, test, and build the action

   ```bash
   npm run all
   ```

   > This step is important! It will run [`ncc`](https://github.com/vercel/ncc)
   > to build the final JavaScript action code with all dependencies included.
   > If you do not run this step, your action will not work correctly when it is
   > used in a workflow. This step also includes the `--license` option for
   > `ncc`, which will create a license file for all of the production node
   > modules used in your project.

1. (Optional) Test your action locally

   The [`@github/local-action`](https://github.com/github/local-action) utility
   can be used to test your action locally. It is a simple command-line tool
   that "stubs" (or simulates) the GitHub Actions Toolkit. This way, you can run
   your TypeScript action locally without having to commit and push your changes
   to a repository.

   The `local-action` utility can be run in the following ways:

   - Visual Studio Code Debugger

     Make sure to review and, if needed, update
     [`.vscode/launch.json`](./.vscode/launch.json)

   - Terminal/Command Prompt

     ```bash
     # npx local action <action-yaml-path> <entrypoint> <dotenv-file>
     npx local-action . src/main.ts .env
     ```

   You can provide a `.env` file to the `local-action` CLI to set environment
   variables used by the GitHub Actions Toolkit. For example, setting inputs and
   event payload data used by your action. For more information, see the example
   file, [`.env.example`](./.env.example), and the
   [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables).

## Publishing a New Release

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> These steps are only relevant for maintainers!

After testing, you create version tag that developers can use to reference
different stable versions of your action. For more information, see
[Versioning](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)
in the GitHub Actions toolkit.

This project includes a helper script, [`script/release`](./script/release)
designed to streamline the process of tagging and pushing new releases for
GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions allows users to select a specific version of the action to use,
based on release tags. This script simplifies this process by performing the
following steps:

1. **Retrieving the latest release tag:** The script starts by fetching the most
   recent SemVer release tag of the current branch, by looking at the local data
   available in your repository.
1. **Prompting for a new release tag:** The user is then prompted to enter a new
   release tag. To assist with this, the script displays the tag retrieved in
   the previous step, and validates the format of the inputted tag (vX.X.X). The
   user is also reminded to update the version field in package.json.
1. **Tagging the new release:** The script then tags a new release and syncs the
   separate major tag (e.g. v1, v2) with the new release tag (e.g. v1.0.0,
   v2.1.2). When the user is creating a new major release, the script
   auto-detects this and creates a `releases/v#` branch for the previous major
   version.
1. **Pushing changes to remote:** Finally, the script pushes the necessary
   commits, tags and branches to the remote repository. From here, you will need
   to create a new release in GitHub so users can easily reference the new tags
   in their workflows.
